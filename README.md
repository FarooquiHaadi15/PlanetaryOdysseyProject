This project is a Planetary Odysset Game similar to the popular game "Oregon Trail". 
You will be responsible for your own crew that you select at the beginning of the game. You must travel to each of the planets listed to you to complete the mission and win the game. 
On each planet there is a random chance of an event occurring and you must make a decision on what action to take. Based on the planet's difficulty, you will have a higher or lower chance of success.

I made this game to test my skills in C++ and working with classes, pointers, and basic C++ functions.
